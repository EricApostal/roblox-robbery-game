# Overall
## Map Zones
TODO: Rivers for divide, use water as the ultimate dividing factor between sections

# Road System
## Highway
In favor of the racing and mobile-robbery aspects of the game, there should be a long highway where such can be faciliated.

## City Streets
For the ease of driving, there should be a sort of artificial widened street. For example, when there's direct obstructions on the side of the road (ie: the city), always use a 4 lane road. When a 2 lane road makes the most sense, still have 2 lanes, but with an allowed margin of error such that driving off the road will still allow you to move fine.


# Views and scenery
## Mountains
Much like in Driving Simulator, I want there to be a mountain that looks over the entire map. This allows for a sort of "completeness", and adds so much more to the game.

## Biomes
I should be putting lots of focus into forestry and nature, and less so to deserts like Jailbreak. I want the map to be packed without being dense, in a way. Where high amounts of detail and contents are everywhere, but you aren't being forced into a dense area (a bit like Wild West, although that tends to lean far more to the forestry side of things, for obvious reasons).
